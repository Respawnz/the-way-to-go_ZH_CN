In [13.7 èŠ‚](13.7.md) we mentioned the principle of performing benchmarks on your functions in Go. Here we  apply  it  to  a  concrete  example  of  a  goroutine  which  is  filled  with  ints,  and  then  read. The functions are called  N times (e.g. N = 1000000) with testing.Benchmark, the BenchMarkResulthas  a String() method  for  outputting  its  findings. The  number  N  is  decided  upon  by  gotest, judging this to be high enough to get a reasonable benchmark result.Of course the same way of benchmarking also applies to ordinary functions.If  you  want  to  exclude  certain  parts  of  the  code  or  you  want  to  be  more  specific  in  what  you are  timing,  you  can  stop  and  start  the  timer  by  calling  functions testing.B.StopTimer()  and testing.B.StartTimer() as appropriate. The benchmarks will only be run if all your tests pass!
